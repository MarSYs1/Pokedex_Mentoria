# About

<p align="center"><img src="./images/pokedex.png" width="20%"></p>

> The Pok√©dex („Éù„Ç±„É¢„É≥Âõ≥Èëë„Åö„Åã„Çì, Pokemon Zukan, Illustrated Pok√©mon Encyclopedia) is an electronic device created and designed to catalog and provide information regarding the various species of Pok√©mon featured in the Pok√©mon video game, anime and manga series. The name Pok√©dex is a neologism including "Pok√©mon" (which itself is a portmanteau of "pocket" and "monster") and "index". The Japanese name is simply "Pok√©mon Encyclopedia", as it can feature every Pok√©mon on it, depending on the Pok√©dex. - <a href="https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9dex" target="_blank">Pokemon Fandom Wiki</a>

This is my very first iOS app I ever made, and I'm already lovin' iOS development üòç. I chose Pokedex as Pokemon was my best childhood game. I remember I would wake up at 6am to train some of my Pokemons before school when I was in elementary school. I hope this app also brings back some good memory if you happen to be a Pokemon fan like me.

This app features 151 Pokemons in the first generation with all the core functionalities search as search by name, ID or type; a map view to display the randomly spawn locations (similar to Pokemon GO).
